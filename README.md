## DevOps 
- Development (AGILE): regular and quick changes
- Operations (ITIL): stability

## Automation application
- code build
- code testing
- software testing
- infrastructure changes
- deployments

## DevOps Lifecycle
- code: developers commits code
- deployable software: artifact
- code test: unit and integration test
- code analysis: vulnerability, best practices
- delivery: deploy changes to staging
- DB changes: operation changes
- software testing: QA/functional, load, performance tests
- deploy to prod
- go live: user traffic diverted to new changes
- user approval/feedback
- continous monitoring

## Continuous Integration
- version control system: centralized code repository
- artifact repo stored in
